-> The coordinates of images are present in images folder which can be stated in main.cpp for applying image interpolation on those images.

-> Use 'clear' button to reselect correspondences
-> Use 'Create mesh' button for mesh generation (currently contour mapping (topological merging))
-> 'clear' and 'create mesh' get disabled once mesh is created
-> 'clear' can't be pushed if correspondences doesn't have same number of points
